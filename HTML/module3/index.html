 	Remember that these essays usually begin with a prompt or quote and then present a specific question or topic to be addressed. The SAT asks students to write an essay in response to the assignment in only 25 minutes. Here’s what a prompt and a sample “12” SAT essay might look like (courtesy of our head tutor, Dr. Ryan Judkins).

The Prompt: Many people are philanthropists, giving money to those in need. And many people believe that those who are rich—those who can afford to give the most—should contribute the most to charitable organizations. Others, however, disagree. Why should those who are more fortunate than others have more of a moral obligation to help those who are less fortunate?

The Assignment: Should people who are more fortunate than others have more of a moral obligation to help those who are less fortunate?

An Example “12” Essay:

John F. Kennedy famously asked, “Ask … what you can do for your country,” not “Ask what others ought to be doing for your country.” Claiming that those more fortunate than oneself have more of a moral obligation to help others is logically flawed at best and disingenuous at worst.

For an ethical obligation to exist within a society, it must be applied equally across the society. In this case, if it is accepted that one has a duty to help those less fortunate than oneself, then that duty should apply equally to all members of the society. There may well be a practical exception to this rule, in that some people may not be financially able to help others as much as another might, but that practical exception does not make for a logical one. Rick may not be able to donate much or at all, while Neal may be able to donate quite a bit, but there’s no greater injunction placed on Neal than on Rick. So, Neal should not be required to donate 30% of his income while Rick is only required to donate 20% (despite the fact that this pattern is indeed how our tax system works to a certain extent). The logic of this stance is proven by extrapolation: if one accepts that greater fortune necessitates a greater moral obligation, then eventually the luckiest or wealthiest people will have moral obligations equal to or surpassing their abilities to meet those obligations.

Moreover, the stance that the more fortunate have a greater obligation is potentially disingenous since “greater” fortune is relative. A millionaire claims that a billionaire should pay more, a billionaire claims the multi-billionaires should pay more and so forth. At its worst, this stance simply passes the duty up the food chain and uses it as an excuse to avoid responsibility.

In the end, an ethical obligation to help those who are less fortunate should be enacted by everyone within their means. It should not be based on a sliding scale of capability that too easily becomes an excuse to avoid responsibility.

Analysis:

This essay is not perfect, but for 25 minutes, it’s pretty spectacular. It states a bold thesis, supports it well with logical extrapolation and examples, and maintains focus throughout. Its employment of tight organization, clear phrasing, and appropriate diction is excellent. It also has a bit of flare, particularly in how it uses a relatively cliche JFK quote as the basis for a humorous extension.

Remember that these essays are scored most heavily on 1) the argument they lay out and 2) how well they support that argument with evidence. This essay does both very well.
